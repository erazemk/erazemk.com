[Anarchy](https://anarchyinstaller.gitlab.io) is an [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) installer,
which combines two great things, an Arch base and having everything set up automatically for you.

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing inherently bad about installing Arch "the Arch way", but I don't want to spend
the whole day setting everything up again (~~or for like the 10th time in a month, since I distro-hop often~~ - I now
use Fedora, which I'm quite happy with, so this statement is no longer accurate).

I stumbled upon Anarchy quite a while ago, when looking for an easier way to install Arch.
I've tested both [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) and Antergos (Now discontinued and replaced by
[EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/)), but I haven't been completely happy with either of them.

I finished high school in 2018 and wanted to do something special during the summer.
At that time Anarchy's development had dried up, it didn't get many updates and obviously even less releases,
so I decided I wanted to contribute to the project - most of it consists of bash scripts anyway,
which is great, since my other bigger project, PiCraft, consists of a bunch of
bash scripts as well, so I at least had some experience with them.
