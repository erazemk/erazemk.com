[PiCraft](https://gitlab.com/picraft) is a portable [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) LAN server, based
on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/).

It is meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi 3 or later and features a clean web user interface, through which parents
(our target audience) can easily set up a LAN (Local Area Network) server for their kids to connect to though PiCraft's
wireless hotspot.
